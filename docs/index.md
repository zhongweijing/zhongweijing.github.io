I'm Zhong Weijing—a dedicated urban planner and GIS researcher with over seven years of hands-on experience in shaping dynamic urban environments. I hold a Master of Engineering in Town and Country Planning from Tongji University and am currently advancing my expertise with a Master of Science in Applied GIS at the National University of Singapore. My career has been marked by multiple aspects of meaningful projects, including directing the Hangzhou Green Space System Special Planning that enhances environmental quality and creates more vibrant environments designing a comprehensive four-tier park system, planning public facilities distribution that fosters high-quality and equitable resource allocation, and formulating land use strategies that guide effective land parcel release and subsequent development. 

I am deeply committed to a **human-centric** planning philosophy that prioritizes urban **liveability** and **sustainability**. I believe that successful urban planning is not merely about spatial design but about enhancing community well-being, improving quality of life, and safeguarding environmental integrity. I am particularly passionate about exploring how thoughtful urban design and strategic planning can enhance people’s daily lives, improve access to essential services, and create healthier, more vibrant environments. By integrating advanced GIS techniques with data-driven decision-making and human-centered design principles, I strive to develop solutions that foster sustainable urban growth, ensuring that cities are not only well-structured but also livable, enjoyable, and sustainable for all.

Here, I share my journey, projects, research endeavors, and vision for future-ready cities, each reflecting my passion for crafting resilient, inclusive, and sustainable cities that seamlessly integrate innovative planning with real-world implementation. 
Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to exploring opportunities for collaboration and innovation in urban development.

Outside work, I enjoy swimming, running and spending quality time with my family, cherishing the moments we share together. In addition, I have a passion for travel, which not only broadens my horizons but also allows me to explore and learn from diverse urban planning practices across different cultures—fueling my commitment to enhancing urban liveability and sustainability.

    
    My 主要方向 interest lies in Urban Liveability and Sustainability, including:
   城市空间发展战略与研究、公共服务设施规划布局、绿色空间规划
    Urban Environment, and Urban Mobility. During the past few years, I have refined and further enriched 
    the concept of Solar Cities and comprehensively developed models to address scientific challenges in the estimation 
    of spatiotemporal solar photovoltaic (PV) potential on 3D urban surfaces...
