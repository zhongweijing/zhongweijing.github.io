## About Me
I am now a lecturer and research associate in Technical University of Munich, Germany, and also affiliated with the GIScience group in Heidelberg Universtiy. Prior to TUM, I received my Ph.D. in the GIScience research group at the Institute of Geography in Heidelberg University, Germany. I got my MS.c degree from University of Stuttgart, Germany, where I was major in Geomatics engineering. Before came to Germany, I got my double BS.c degrees in both Geographical Information Systems and Computer Science at Wuhan University, China.

Besides research, I enjoy basketball, cylcing, and running. In addition, I’m also a big fan of cooking for my family, just cannot stop trying all differents delicious cuisines.

    My research interest lies in Urban Sustainability, including three interconnected fields: Solar Cities, 
    Urban Environment, and Urban Mobility. During the past few years, I have refined and further enriched 
    the concept of Solar Cities and comprehensively developed models to address scientific challenges in the estimation 
    of spatiotemporal solar photovoltaic (PV) potential on 3D urban surfaces...
